# grunt-wp-readme-to-markdown

> Converts WordPress readme.txt file to markdown (readme.md)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `>=0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-wp-readme-to-markdown --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wp-readme-to-markdown');
```

## The "wp_readme_to_markdown" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `wp_readme_to_markdown` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  wp_readme_to_markdown: {
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

#### screenshot_url
Type: `String`/`Bool`
Default value: `false`

*Prior to 2.0.0 the default value had been `http://ps.w.org/{plugin}/assets/{screenshot}.png`. Please see [#14](https://github.com/stephenharris/wp-readme-to-markdown/issues/14) for the reasons for the change.*

The url/path used for the screenshot images. If left as `false`, no screenshot images will be included. Alternatively you can provide a:

 1. A relative path to the images (commited to the repo) `assets/{screenshot}.png`
 2. A URL to a website hosting the images: `http://example.com/{screenshot}.png`
 3. The wordpress.org hosted screenshots**\***: `http://ps.w.org/{plugin}/assets/{screenshot}.png`

There are placeholders to available for use in the URL structure. `{plugin}` is replaced by the plug-in name (as determined by the readme) and `{screenshot}` is replaced by `screenshot-X` where `X` is a number indexing the screenshots (starting from 1).

**\*** Actual URL of the wordpress.org hosted screenshots can vary. Please see [#14](https://github.com/stephenharris/wp-readme-to-markdown/issues/14) for details.

#### pre_convert
Type: `function`
Default value: `noop`

A function which filters the value of the original readme file before it is converted. You should return the (modified) content. Returning a `false` value has the same effect as not providing a callback at all: the original readme file content is used.

#### post_convert
Type: `function`
Default value: `noop`

A function which filters the value of the converted readme content immediately before it is written to file. You should return the (modified) content. Returning a `false` value has the same effect as not providing a callback at all: the converted readme content is written to file unchanged.

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
WordPress `readme.txt` should live in the root of your plug-in, so typical usage would be to set the source as `readme.txt` and the destination as `readme.md`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  wp_readme_to_markdown: {
	your_target: {
	    files: {
	      'readme.md': 'readme.txt'
	    },
	},
  },
})
```
## Using with Github Actions
If you host your primary plugin development on Github, you can use Actions to automatically generate the markdown version of the readme during the commit.  An action like the following can be used:

```
name: Generate readme.md from readme.txt

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "master" ]
    paths: [ "readme.txt" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Build
      run: |
        npm install
        grunt
        git config --global user.name '${{secrets.GIT_USERNAME}}'
        git config --global user.email '${{secrets.GIT_EMAIL}}'
        git commit -am "Regenerate readme.md"
        git push
```

Make sure to set your GIT_USERNAME/GIT_EMAIL secrets so that the commit of the markdown file will work.
